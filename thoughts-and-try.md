```sql
-- Check if user A (wp_user_id = 2) is a friend of user B (member_id = 3)
SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM wp_cospend_members
WHERE( created_by = 2 AND id = 3)

SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM wp_cospend_members
if WHERE( created_by = 2 AND id = 3) exist, get this row.wp_user_id as friend_id
then

OR (wp_user_id = 2 AND created_by = 3)

we need to count the row counts that match any of these conditions:

1. WHERE( created_by = 2 AND id = 3)
2. WHERE( wp_user_id = 2 AND created_by = friend_wp_user_id) here friend_wp_user_id is row.wp_user_id when condition 1 is true

SELECT COUNT(\*) AS total_count
FROM wp_cospend_members
WHERE
(created_by = 2 AND id = 3)
OR
(
wp_user_id = 2
AND created_by = (
SELECT wp_user_id
FROM wp_cospend_members
WHERE created_by = 2 AND id = 3
LIMIT 1
)
);

-- check user A and member B are in the same group
-- we have group_id, wp_user_id (User A), member_id (User B) and table name is wp_cospend_group_members

1. check if User B is a member of the group where group_id = group_id
2. Get all the member ids where wp_user_id = User A
3. Check if any of these member ids are in the list of member ids where group_id = group_id
